With this I tried to request data from Business Central via API. This is Kind of a series where I try to implement Machine Learning Algorithms into Business Central.
The first Step was to learn about Machine Learning (which is still going on). And the second Step is to Get Data from Business Central and to process it in Python. I Consider this done.
Now I want to focus more on Step 1 again. But the Goal is to implement Machine Learning into Business Central. The user only has to click a action button which then starts the calcultaion process, prints out the results and saves them. This is not so easy for me because I'm relatively new to programming and there isn't that much documentation.
